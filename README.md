# My-Projects
These files contain the code we developed for our second-year project. 
The project consisted of building an autonomous buggy that followed a white line. 
The code was written in C/C++ and various pre-written libraries were utilized. 
The encoder file contains the code to implement an encoder that calculates the buggy's speed and position.
The sonar file contains the code that was used to control the buggy's movement by reading the signals that were generated from a sonar sensor. The code allows the buggy to calculate its distance from a wall and come to a stop when the wall is 3 meters away from the buggy. 
The buggy's control algorithm was implemented using PID control to provide stable and quick maneuvering.
A full report is also attached that explains the complete procedure from A-Z and emphasizes the different stages involved.
